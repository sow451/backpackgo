Backpack GO is an interactive game that allows players to input latitude and longitude coordinates and explore the world.

I made this game using pure HTML, CSS and some JS. The game was made in a couple of hours, and was made as an extension of the Inktober 2024 prompt of the day: Backpack.

Players can see where they are after they enter a lat and long. The game displays an alert that suggests they're in the ocean, if their co-ordinates take them to a water-based location. 

The game is designed for a simple, educational experience for 4-8 year old. 

Additionally, I tried to add the following, but was not able to: 

1. Add lat/long overlays on the maps
2. Return the name of the waterbody by using a different geo-coding for marine resources API. 
3. Restrict the input text to only take 5 characters (will look into when I have time)

I learnt how to: 

1. Integrate Leaflet Maps
2. Generally learnt about lat and long
3. How to do reverse geo-coding using open source APIs

User-tested this with my 6-yo and found that he struggled a bit initially to get the marker to land on ..land and not the oceans. However once he got it a few hits on land, he was thrilled.
